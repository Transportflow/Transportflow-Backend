# ðŸ“– API Documentation
This documentation is meant to give an overview over
how this Transportflow data source can be used.
For a better structure it is split up into several parts.

- [Provider selection](./providers.md): Use these endpoints to view in available transport providers
- [Stop search](./search.md): Query stops around you or by name with these endpoints
- [Departures](./departures.md): Find departures, their next stops or wagon order
